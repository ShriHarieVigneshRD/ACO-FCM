# Community Detection in Social Networks using ACO and Fuzzy Clustering

## Overview
This project detects communities in social networks using **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** for initial clustering and **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)** for refinement. The goal is to maximize **modularity** to enhance community quality.

## Methodology
1. **Exploration (ACO):** Ants traverse the graph, depositing pheromones to highlight strong connections.
2. **Construction:** Communities are formed based on pheromone levels.
3. **Optimization (FCM):** Communities are refined using fuzzy clustering.

## Key Steps
- **Initialization:** Graph setup, pheromone assignment.
- **ACO-Based Exploration:** Ants navigate the network, selecting edges probabilistically.
- **Community Construction:** Sorting edges by pheromone levels to create clusters.
- **Refinement (FCM):** Nodes reassigned based on fuzzy membership.
- **Pheromone Update:** Reinforcing strong connections iteratively.
- **FCM:** Applied FCM to fine tune results.

## Implementation
The method is implemented in Python using network analysis libraries. The algorithm optimizes community detection with competitive results.

## Conclusion
This hybrid approach efficiently detects communities, outperforming traditional methods. Future work includes handling weighted and directed graphs.
